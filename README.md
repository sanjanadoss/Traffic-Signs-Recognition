## Autonmous Vehicles
<p float="left">
A vehicle that can sense its surroundings and function without human intervention is an autonomous vehicle. <br>
There is no requirement for a human passenger to operate the car at any moment or even to be inside the vehicle at all.
An autonomous vehicle can go anywhere a traditional vehicle can go and can perform any task that a skilled human driver can.
